# tnb-bill-calculator
> By Eyad Mohamed Ali

## Why?
This is the code for a `MATLAB` assignment at my [university](https://www.ucsiuniversity.edu.my/) under the course with a code of _FAS1074_. Essentially it is an electricity bill calculator using `MATLAB`.

## The Process of Development
1. gathered the current electricity rates on the [TNB Website](https://www.mytnb.com.my/residential/understand-your-bill/pricing-tariff).
2. reverse-engineered the calculation process (including [ICPT](https://www.tnb.com.my/faq/icpt-english/) and Service Tax)
3. layed-out a plan on how the general flow of the program would go
4. translated that plan into the language of `MATLAB`

## How to run the program
1. Download the files in the git repo either by doing a `git-clone` or by simply downloading it as a zip file
2. Place all the files in the same directory
3. Open up the `MATLAB` command window, and enter the command `main` (or simply press "run" while the _main_ program is open)
4. Congrats! the program is now running (hopefully)

## TODO
* [ ] Make a GUI for the program
* [ ] Write a better README -_-
